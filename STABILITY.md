# Stability Contract · 0.x

What agents and CI integrations can rely on across versions of Agents Shipgate.

This document is the contract. If the runtime ever diverges from what's documented here, that's a bug — please file an issue.

## What WILL NOT change in 0.x

### CLI command surface

These commands and flags are stable across all `0.x.y` releases. They will only change in a major version bump (`1.0.0`):

| Command | Stable flags |
|---|---|
| `agents-shipgate scan` | `-c`, `--config`, `--out`, `--format`, `--ci-mode`, `--fail-on`, `--baseline`, `--no-plugins`, `--verbose`, `--workspace`, `--packet`/`--no-packet`, `--packet-format` |
| `agents-shipgate evidence-packet` | `--from`, `--out`, `--format`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate init` | `--workspace`, `--write`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate doctor` | `-c`, `--config`, `--workspace`, `--json`, `--verbose` |
| `agents-shipgate explain` | `<check_id>`, `--no-plugins`, `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate list-checks` | `--json`, `--no-plugins` |
| `agents-shipgate baseline save` | `-c`, `--config`, `--out` |
| `agents-shipgate fixture list` | `--json` |
| `agents-shipgate fixture run` | `<name>`, `--ci-mode`, `--out` |
| `agents-shipgate fixture copy` | `<name>`, `--to` |
| `agents-shipgate fixture verify` | `<name>` |
| `agents-shipgate self-check` | `--json` |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Pass — advisory mode or strict mode with no `fail_on` matches |
| `2` | Manifest config error (missing/typo/invalid) |
| `3` | Input parse error (malformed YAML/JSON, file too large, path traversal blocked) |
| `4` | Other Agents Shipgate error |
| `20` | Strict-mode gate failure (≥ 1 unsuppressed finding hit `fail_on`) |

### JSON report fields (stable)

In `agents-shipgate-reports/report.json`, the following are guaranteed:

- `report_schema_version` — bumps minor on additive changes, major on breaking
- `release_decision.{decision, reason, blockers, review_items, evidence_coverage, baseline_delta, fail_policy}` (v0.8+)
- `release_decision.fail_policy.{ci_mode, fail_on, new_findings_only, would_fail_ci, exit_code}`
- `release_decision.blockers[].{id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, title, baseline_status}` and `release_decision.review_items[].{id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, title, baseline_status}` (reference-only — both arrays share the same item shape; full Finding payload is in `findings[]`)
- `capability_facts[].{id, tool_name, source_type, source_ref, capability, risk_tags, auth_scopes, owner, included_reason, control_status, related_findings}` (v0.9+)
- `declared_intentions[].{id, kind, text, source, intent_tags}` (v0.9+)
- `misalignments[].{id, kind, severity, tool_name, capability_refs, intention_refs, finding_refs, policy_requirement, gap, release_implication}` (v0.9+)
- `release_consequence.{decision, summary, blocker_misalignment_count, review_misalignment_count, fail_policy}` (v0.9+)
- `suggested_scenarios[].{id, scenario_type, title, given, expected_control, source_misalignments, source_findings}` (v0.9+)
- `summary.{critical_count, high_count, medium_count, low_count, info_count, suppressed_count, status, human_review_recommended}`
- `findings[].{id, fingerprint, check_id, severity, category, title, recommendation, suppressed}`
- `findings[].tool_name` (string or null)
- `findings[].source.{type, ref, location}` (when available)
- `baseline.{matched_count, new_count, resolved_count, path}` (when `--baseline` is used)
- `tool_inventory[].{name, source_type, source_ref, risk_tags, auth_scopes, owner, confidence}`
- `loaded_plugins[].{name, value, distribution, version, check_id}`

#### `release_decision.decision` vs `summary.status`

These are **intentionally different signals**, kept apart for backwards compatibility:

| Field | Baseline-aware? | Recommended for release gating? |
|---|---|---|
| `release_decision.decision` | yes — baseline-matched criticals appear in `review_items`, not `blockers` | **yes (v0.8+)** |
| `summary.status` | no — any unsuppressed critical flips status to `release_blockers_detected` | preserved for v0.7 callers |

Concretely: a scan with one baseline-matched critical and zero new findings produces `summary.status = "release_blockers_detected"` AND `release_decision.decision = "review_required"`. Both are correct under their respective contracts. New consumers should read `release_decision.decision`.

### Check IDs

Once a check ID ships in a tagged release (`SHIP-POLICY-APPROVAL-MISSING`, `SHIP-ADK-GUARDRAIL-EVIDENCE-MISSING`, etc.), it will not be:

- Renamed
- Removed (only deprecated, with at least one minor-version cycle)
- Repurposed (the conditions under which it fires may *narrow* but never broaden in a way that breaks existing suppressions)

New check IDs may be added in any minor release. If your CI pins severities by check ID, expect new checks to surface as new findings.

### Fingerprint algorithm

`fingerprint = "fp_" + sha256(check_id | tool_name | canonical_evidence)[:16]`

Where `canonical_evidence`:
- Sorts dict keys recursively
- Sorts list items by JSON repr
- **Excludes** the `default_severity` audit-evidence key (so applying `severity_overrides` does not change identity)

Fingerprints are stable across runs on the same input. They are the identity primitive used by suppressions and baselines.

### Trust-model invariants

The scanner does not, under any circumstances:

- Execute or import user code (the SDK loaders use `ast.parse` only)
- Make HTTP requests
- Connect to MCP servers
- Invoke LLMs
- Send telemetry

Plugins are off by default. `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_ENABLE_PLUGINS=1` enables loading; `--no-plugins` overrides at the CLI level. When loaded, every plugin is enumerated in `report.loaded_plugins`.

### Manifest schema

The manifest schema version (`version: "0.1"`) is independent of the CLI version. Manifest schema changes follow their own deprecation cycle. A `0.1`-shaped manifest will load correctly across all `0.x.y` CLI releases.

### Release Evidence Packet (v0.1)

`agents-shipgate-reports/packet.json` is governed by [`docs/packet-schema.v0.1.json`](docs/packet-schema.v0.1.json). Within `0.x`:

- `packet_schema_version` is a real field on every emitted packet; minor bumps are additive.
- All ten sections (release_decision, capability_intent, high_risk_surface, approval_coverage, idempotency_risk, scope_coverage, memory_isolation, human_in_the_loop, dynamic_scenarios, not_proven) are always present.
- `release_decision.verdict` always derives from `release_decision.decision`. CI behavior (`fail_policy`) is rendered separately as metadata, never as the verdict.
- `not_proven.unconditional` always lists the four canonical disclaimers verbatim — prompt robustness, runtime behavior, model correctness, adversarial resistance.
- The packet is a local artifact (`agents-shipgate-reports/packet.{md,json,html}`, optionally `packet.pdf` with the `[pdf]` extras). There is no hosted/SaaS surface.

### Fixture names

Fixture names listed by `agents-shipgate fixture list` are stable. Names will not be renamed. New fixtures may be added.

### Agent-skill paths

The following paths are part of the public agent surface and will not move within `0.x`:

- [`prompts/`](prompts/) — task-shaped recipes, individual filenames are stable
- [`.claude/commands/shipgate.md`](.claude/commands/shipgate.md) — Claude Code `/shipgate` slash command
- [`skills/agents-shipgate/SKILL.md`](skills/agents-shipgate/SKILL.md) — Claude Code skill. Frontmatter `name` is fixed at `agents-shipgate` (deliberately distinct from the `/shipgate` command so the skill cannot preempt it). Trigger phrases in `description` may broaden additively but will not narrow.
- [`skills/agents-shipgate/prompts/`](skills/agents-shipgate/prompts/) and [`skills/agents-shipgate/ci-recipes/`](skills/agents-shipgate/ci-recipes/) — bundled supporting files the skill references via relative paths. Filenames listed in `SKILL.md` are stable.

The body content of these files may change to reflect new prompts; the entry-point paths will not.

## What MAY change additively in any minor release

These are not stable — assume they may grow but not shrink:

- **Risk-tag taxonomy.** New tags may appear (e.g. `infrastructure_change`, `code_execution`). Existing tags' meanings will not change.
- **`capability_facts[].capability` vocabulary.** Values are an open vocabulary seeded from risk tags plus review sentinels such as `wildcard_tool_surface` and `unknown`.
- **Report `frameworks.{name}` blocks.** New framework summaries (e.g. `frameworks.langchain`) may appear.
- **Manifest fields.** New optional fields under existing sections.
- **Check default severities.** May tighten over time. To pin a severity for your repo, use `checks.severity_overrides`.

---

## What MAY change in any minor release

These are explicitly NOT part of the public contract:

- **Internal module layout** under `src/agents_shipgate/`. Importing from non-public modules will break.
- **Markdown report layout.** Section ordering, exact wording, and table format may change. Parse the JSON report instead.
- **Risk classifier keyword sets** in `core/risk_hints.py`. False positives are tuned over time. To pin specific behavior, use `risk_overrides.tools.{tool}.{tags,remove_tags}` in your manifest.
- **Default `init` template.** The starter manifest format may grow new sections.
- **`CheckMetadata.evidence_fields`** content. New keys may be added to a check's evidence dict.

If you need stability guarantees beyond what's listed here, please open an issue describing the use case.

## Versioning

We follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) loosely:

- **Patch** (`0.5.x`): bug fixes only. No new features, no breaking changes.
- **Minor** (`0.x.0`): new features (new checks, new input loaders, new flags). Adheres to this contract.
- **Major** (`1.0.0`): may break the contract. Will be announced with a migration guide.

The current version is in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Changelog is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Reporting a contract violation

If you encounter behavior that contradicts this document — for example, an unsuppressed finding for a deprecated check ID, or a stable JSON field that disappeared — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/issues/new) with:

1. The version of `agents-shipgate` (`agents-shipgate --version`)
2. The expected behavior per this document
3. The observed behavior (output, error message, JSON fragment)

Stability bugs are prioritized.
