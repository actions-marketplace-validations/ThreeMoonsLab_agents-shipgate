# Agent Release Gate

An **Agent Release Gate** is a static, manifest-based pre-flight check that runs before an agent is promoted to staging, production-like, or production environments.

Agents Shipgate focuses on the tool surface: what tools are attached, what schemas they expose, what scopes they require, what policies the manifest declares, and which release risks need human review.

## What It Is

- A CI-friendly scanner for `shipgate.yaml`, local MCP exports, local OpenAPI specs, and optional SDK AST metadata.
- A deterministic report of blockers, warnings, evidence, confidence, and recommended actions.
- A way to make agent release review repeatable before runtime traces exist.

## What It Is Not

- An LLM eval framework.
- An MCP runtime gateway.
- A runtime guardrail or policy enforcement proxy.
- An observability platform.
- A safety or compliance certification.
