# Prompt · Add Agents Shipgate to a repo

You are working in a repo that may contain an AI agent — likely one of: an MCP server tool list (`*mcp*.json` or `.agents-shipgate/*.json`), an OpenAPI spec the agent calls, a Python file with `@function_tool` / `@tool` decorators (OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain, CrewAI), a Google ADK agent in `agent.py`, an Anthropic Messages API artifact set under `prompts/`/`tools/anthropic-tools.json`/`policies/anthropic-policy.yaml`, or an OpenAI API artifact set under `prompts/`/`tools/openai-tools.json`/`openai-config.json`.

Your job is to drive the canonical 4-call flow end-to-end in one tool-using turn.

## Your task

1. **Install the tool:**
   ```bash
   pipx install agents-shipgate
   ```
   If `pipx` is unavailable, use `python -m pip install agents-shipgate` and verify with `agents-shipgate --version`.

2. **Sanity-check the install** before touching the user's code:
   ```bash
   agents-shipgate self-check --json
   ```
   Confirm `"ready": true`. If not, surface the failure to the user.

3. **Detect:**
   ```bash
   agents-shipgate detect --workspace . --json
   ```
   Read the response: `is_agent_project`, `frameworks[]` (per-framework score + evidence + candidate files), `agent_name_candidates[]`, `suggested_sources[]` (MCP/OpenAPI files matched by glob).

   **Stop only when ALL of these hold:** `is_agent_project: false`, `suggested_sources` is empty, no `shipgate.yaml` already exists in the workspace, AND the user did not explicitly request a scan. Otherwise proceed — MCP/OpenAPI tool-surface repos register as `is_agent_project: false` because they have no Python framework imports, but they are valid Shipgate targets and their hits surface as `suggested_sources`.

4. **Generate a starter manifest + GitHub Actions workflow:**
   ```bash
   agents-shipgate init --workspace . --write --ci --json
   ```
   The `--json` form returns:
   - `manifest_status`: `"written"` | `"skipped_existing"` | `"not_attempted"`
   - `workflow.status` (with `--ci`): `"written"` | `"skipped_existing_target"` | `"skipped_cross_reference"`
   - `placeholders[]` — entries the template intentionally left as `CHANGE_ME` because no high-confidence signal was available
   - `auto_detected.agent_name` — the value the manifest carries (`null` when the template fell back to `CHANGE_ME`)

   `--ci` writes `.github/workflows/agents-shipgate.yml` orthogonally to `--write`. Each gets its own overwrite-refusal check; existing workflows that already call `ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate` skip with a distinct `cross_reference_path`.

5. **Replace placeholders.** Walk `placeholders[]` from the JSON output. On a fresh workspace the template typically leaves two:
   - `agent.name: CHANGE_ME` — replace with the agent's actual role (no strong `Agent(name="…")` literal was found in the source).
   - `agent.declared_purpose[]: CHANGE_ME` — replace with a one-line description of what the agent should do (auto-init can't infer this; the schema requires a non-empty value).

   Read the agent's prompt or main file to derive both. Skipping this leaves an invalid adoption artifact — the manifest validates but downstream consumers see meaningless defaults.

6. **Run the scan with patch suggestions:**
   ```bash
   agents-shipgate scan -c shipgate.yaml --suggest-patches --format json --ci-mode advisory
   ```
   The report lands at `agents-shipgate-reports/report.json`. Parse it. Per-finding fields you can rely on (v0.7+):
   - `check_id`, `severity`, `category`, `tool_name`, `recommendation`, `suppressed`
   - `autofix_safe`, `requires_human_review`, `suggested_patch_kind`, `docs_url`
   - `patches[]` (only with `--suggest-patches`) — each has `kind` ∈ `{set_pointer, append_pointer, remove_pointer, manual}` plus `confidence` + `target_file` + etc. for non-manual kinds.

   Top-level: `summary.{status, critical_count, high_count, medium_count}`, `manifest_dir` (absolute path of the manifest's directory — used by `apply-patches` for the containment check).

7. **Apply the safe patches:**
   ```bash
   agents-shipgate apply-patches --from agents-shipgate-reports/report.json --confidence high --apply --json
   ```
   Default `--confidence high` only mutates patches whose `confidence` field is `"high"`. Today that's the 3 stale-manifest removals. Scope-coverage appends ship at `medium` and require explicit `--confidence medium` to apply. ManualPatches are never auto-applied.

   **Decision tree** for walking the report:
   ```
   for finding in active_findings:
       if finding.suggested_patch_kind in ("manual", "none"):
           surface_to_user(finding)              # Surface; do NOT auto-apply.
           continue
       if finding.autofix_safe is True:
           plan_to_apply(finding)                # Will be applied at --confidence high.
           continue
       surface_for_medium_review(finding)        # Medium-confidence — opt-in only.
   ```

   Trace findings (`SHIP-API-TRACE-{APPROVAL,CONFIRMATION}-MISSING`) are permanent ManualPatch by policy. Implement the runtime gate; never edit the trace recording — that patches the evidence, not the agent. See [`docs/autofix-policy.md`](https://github.com/ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate/blob/main/docs/autofix-policy.md) for the full classification.

8. **Add `agents-shipgate-reports/` to `.gitignore`** if it isn't already. The reports are scan artifacts, not source.

9. **Report back to the user**:
   - The `summary.status` (`release_blockers_detected`, `warnings_detected`, etc.)
   - The top 3 active critical/high findings (use `report.json`, not stdout)
   - Which patches were applied (count from `apply-patches --json` output's `files`)
   - Any check IDs the user should investigate first — link to `docs_url` from the finding for full rationale, or use `agents-shipgate explain <CHECK_ID> --json` for the same content via CLI

## What to do if the scan errors out

Set `AGENTS_SHIPGATE_AGENT_MODE=1` and re-run. The CLI will append a JSON line to stderr with `{error, message, next_action}`. Follow the `next_action`.

Common errors and fixes:

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Config file not found: shipgate.yaml` | Run `agents-shipgate init --workspace . --write` first |
| `Input path '...' resolves outside manifest directory` | The declared `tool_sources[].path` is outside the manifest dir. Move the spec inside the tree, symlink it, or copy it |
| `Invalid shipgate.yaml: ... Did you mean X?` | A field is at the wrong nesting level; move it as suggested |
| `Containment violation` (apply-patches exit 5) | A patch's `target_file` resolved outside `report.manifest_dir`. Re-run scan to refresh; never patch arbitrary system files |

## What NOT to do

- Do **not** commit `agents-shipgate-reports/` — it's regenerated each run.
- Do **not** run `agents-shipgate baseline save` until the user has reviewed the initial findings. Baselining ratchets in noise that strict CI will silently ignore. The right time to baseline is **after** the user has decided which findings they accept.
- Do **not** suppress findings without a real `reason` — the manifest validator rejects empty reasons, and the `reason` field is the audit trail when someone asks "why is this OK?"
- Do **not** use `risk_overrides.tools.{tool}.remove_tags` to silence a finding without checking whether the heuristic is actually wrong. Prefer `checks.ignore` with a reason.
- Do **not** edit a trace recording to flip `approved` or `confirmed` — implement the runtime gate instead.

## Verification before reporting success

- `agents-shipgate-reports/report.json` exists and parses as JSON
- `report.json` carries `report_schema_version: "0.8"` (or higher) and a non-empty `manifest_dir`
- `shipgate.yaml` has no `CHANGE_ME` values (comments containing the literal `CHANGE_ME` are informational and OK)
- `.gitignore` contains `agents-shipgate-reports/` (or equivalent)
- If `--ci` ran with `workflow.status: "written"`: `.github/workflows/agents-shipgate.yml` exists and references `ThreeMoonsLab/agents-shipgate@v…`
- The user knows the top 3 findings and at least one suggested next step
